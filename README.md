Algorithmics and data structures are foundational areas of computer science. Algorithmics deals with the development and analysis of algorithms, while data structures focus on how data is organized and stored to support efficient operations. These fields are interconnected and essential for solving complex computational problems and designing software that performs well in terms of time and space efficiency.
