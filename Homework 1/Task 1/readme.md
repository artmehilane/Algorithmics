# Task 1: Sorting Algorithm for Books by Height
To create an algorithm for sorting books on a shelf by height, you can follow these steps:

Start with an unsorted list of books. Compare the height of the first book with the height of the second book. If the first book is taller than the second book, swap their positions. Move to the next pair of books and repeat the comparison and swapping process until you reach the end of the list. After one pass through the list, the tallest book should be at the end of the list. Repeat steps 2-5 for the remaining books, excluding the last one. Continue this process until all books are sorted by height. Create a pseudocode or a structured explanation of this algorithm and provide a diagram illustrating its working principle.
