# Task 1: Sorting Algorithm for Books by Height
To create an algorithm for sorting books on a shelf by height, you can follow these steps:

Start with an unsorted list of books.
Compare the height of the first book with the height of the second book.
If the first book is taller than the second book, swap their positions.
Move to the next pair of books and repeat the comparison and swapping process until you reach the end of the list.
After one pass through the list, the tallest book should be at the end of the list.
Repeat steps 2-5 for the remaining books, excluding the last one.
Continue this process until all books are sorted by height.
Create a pseudocode or a structured explanation of this algorithm and provide a diagram illustrating its working principle.

# Task 2: LIFO/FIFO Data Structure
Choose either a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) or FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure and implement it in your preferred programming language without using any built-in libraries. Document your code and analyze and measure the time complexity of insertion and deletion operations, explaining your reasoning.

# Task 3: Recursive Fibonacci Function
Write a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. Ensure that the function handles non-negative integer inputs. Provide the code for the recursive Fibonacci function and a brief explanation of your recursive approach.

# Task 4: Binary Search Algorithm
Design a binary search algorithm that finds a specific integer in a sorted list of integers. Your algorithm should return the index of the integer if found, or a message stating that the integer is not in the list. Implement the algorithm, provide the code, and briefly explain your implementation.

# Task 5: Drawing a Tree
Create a tree diagram using a graphical tool or by hand on paper. The tree should consist of 10-15 nodes representing distinct entities or positions, and the edges should describe their relationships. Clearly label each node and its connections to others. Afterward, write a brief comparison between trees and general graphs, highlighting the characteristics that make trees unique. Provide examples of situations where a structure is a graph rather than a tree.
