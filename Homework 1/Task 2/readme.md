# Task 2: LIFO/FIFO Data Structure
Choose either a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) or FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure and implement it in your preferred programming language without using any built-in libraries. Document your code and analyze and measure the time complexity of insertion and deletion operations, explaining your reasoning.
